# DEBUGGING USING SPIKE COMMAND
## using the previously made c code

   
The instruction set (Object Dump) is given below.

 ## The  **main** starts from hexadecimal  value 100b0 in assembly language followed by several other commands.

   
 To start debugging we run the command 
 
         spike -d pk sum1ton.o 
 

 ## The program counter (pc) was run till a certain instruction(100b0) and it was manually run after that for debugging. 
##   Each instruction was run by clicking enter each time.

          until pc 0 100b0

runs at core 0 from beginning to 100b0
## We the use the command 
          reg 0 a2

 to see the contents we use the given register
#### NOTE : LUI stands for Load Upper Immediate.  

## To see the content of the reg

## After that if we press enter it will move onto next set of instruction

again to check the contents we use the command.

          reg 0 sp

#### sp stands for the stack pointer the stack is like a special memory storage where the computer keeps track of temporary data , the decimal -16 means that the content in sp got upadted to 10 in hexadecimal 
          


##      hit q to quit and the run the command again :  
The contents of the Stack Pointer(SP) register was observed. The stack pointer register(SP) instruction was run and the contents of the SP were looked at again.


           spike -d pk sum1ton.o




## Then we use the command 
      reg 0 sp

then one can notice that the value got reduced by 10 hexadecimal or by 16 in decimal

#### NOTE :  addi stands for add immediate itâ€™s an instruction in the RISC-V assembly language that adds a constant number to a register.
